# CIFAR-100

CIFAR data sets are one of the most well-known data sets in computer vision. There are 100 different category labels containing 600 images for each (1 testing image for 5 training images per class). The 100 classes in the CIFAR-100 are grouped into 20 super-classes. Each image comes with a “fine” label (the class to which it belongs) and a “coarse” label (the super-class to which it belongs).
